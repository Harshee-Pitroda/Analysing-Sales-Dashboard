## Step 1 - Designing the Dashboard Mockup

Before jumping into Tableau, I sketched out a **dashboard wireframe** to ensure a logical flow of insights. The goal was to make data both **visually appealing and easy to interpret**.

### **Key Elements in My Mockup as per user stories:**

âœ” **KPI Overview** â€“ A quick summary of Total Sales, Total Profits, and Total Quantity, comparing them to the previous year.

âœ” **Sales Trends** â€“ Monthly trends for key metrics, highlighting high and low sales periods.

âœ” **Product Subcategory Comparison** â€“ A bar-in-bar chart showing sales performance across different subcategories, including profit margins.

âœ” **Weekly Trends for Sales & Profit** â€“ A breakdown of weekly sales trends with emphasis on above-average and below-average weeks.

âœ” **Filters & Search Pane** â€“ An interactive section to allow users to explore data dynamically.

This mockup helped me **visualize the layout** and ensured that each component had a clear purpose before bringing it into Tableau.

## Step 2 - Deciding the color scheme

Once the layout was finalized, I shifted my focus to selecting the right **color scheme**â€”an essential step in making the dashboard intuitive and engaging.

### **Color Choices & Their Purpose:**

ðŸŽ¨ **Red/Orange for Total Sales & Quantity** â€“ Since these KPIs can fluctuate significantly, these colors help signal changes clearly, especially declines.

ðŸŽ¨ **Green for Total Profits** â€“ A positive indicator, reinforcing growth or improvement.

ðŸŽ¨ **Consistent Icons & Labels** â€“ Up/down arrows for percentage changes to enhance clarity.

ðŸŽ¨ **Subtle Background & Borders** â€“ Keeping it clean and distraction-free to maintain readability.

The aim was to **use colors strategically**, not just aesthetically, ensuring that trends and insights pop out without overwhelming the viewer.

## Step 3 - Creating my Data Model

Now that I have my **dashboard mockup and color scheme** finalized, the next step is structuring my **data model** to ensure smooth integration and analysis in Tableau.

### **Data Profiling: Understanding My Tables**

I started by analyzing the available tables and categorizing them into **dimension tables** (descriptive data) and **fact tables** (measurable data).

ðŸ“Œ **Customer Table (Dimension Table)**

- Contains **Customer ID** and **Customer Name**.
- Used for **customer-based filtering and aggregation**.

ðŸ“Œ **Location Table (Dimension Table)**

- Includes **City, Country, Region, State, and Postal Code**.
- Helps with **geographical analysis and mapping** in Tableau.

ðŸ“Œ **Orders Table (Fact Table)**

- The **main transactional table** containing **Customer ID, Product ID (foreign keys), and various measures**.
- Used for **sales, profit, and quantity analysis**.

ðŸ“Œ **Product Table (Dimension Table)**

- Contains **product-specific attributes**.
- Useful for **category-based analysis.**

## Step 4 - Building Chart and Dashboarding

Transforming business requirements into charts was no easy taskâ€”far from a one-and-done process! ðŸ¤ª

I went through multiple iterations of the dashboard, refining it each time and uncovering hidden mistakes along the way. Below, you'll find an attached image where Iâ€™ve broken down and analyzed every aspect of my dasboard

This is the initial version after simply placing all the elements (charts) on the dashboard. I included it to highlight that dashboards donâ€™t instantly look polishedâ€”just placing the charts is only the beginning!

This was my first dashboard design, created before I read "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (an absolutely amazing book!).

After gaining new insights, I revisited every aspect of my dashboard. You can check out my detailed review in the image below!

After making improvements, my dashboard just got an upgrade (Dashboard OS 2.0 ðŸ¤ª) â€”especially in terms of clarity and effectiveness!
